## 🎨 UI/UX Design Planning  

### 🏆 Design Goals  
- Create a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface.  
- Ensure responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
- Provide seamless navigation between listing, details, and checkout.  
- Focus on accessibility and readability for all users.  

### 🔑 Key Features to Implement  
- Clear property search and filtering options.  
- High-quality property images with easy browsing.  
- Simple booking flow with minimal clicks.  
- Visual consistency across pages (colors, typography, spacing).  
- Prominent call-to-action buttons for booking.  

### 📄 Primary Pages Overview  

| Page | Description | Key Elements |  
|------|-------------|--------------|  
| **Property Listing View** | Displays multiple properties with essential details. | Property cards, images, price, location, filters, and search bar. |  
| **Listing Detailed View** | Provides complete details of a selected property. | Large images, amenities, reviews, price per night, booking button. |
